### Toggle Switch

The toggle switch is a state holding gate and consists of two promoters each followed by a coding sequence. Each promoter is repressed by the protein transcribed by the other promoter [2].

When opening [SynBioSuite](https://synbiosuite.org/) in Google Chrome click the blue __Open Folder__ button located in the top left corner. Select this folder, _Example 4_, and allow the site to edit its files. When you open the directory, there will be 2 files in it: i) An OMEX file containing the design and parameters of the GeneticToggleSwitch and, ii) an Analysis that you can use to simulate and observe the predictions.

When opening the Analysis with a double click you can click the __Run Analysis__ button to start the simulation. After the simulation is finished you will see a blue 1 next to the _RESULTS_ tab in the top left corner. After selecting the _RESULTS_ tab, select _IPTG_, _aTc_, and _GFP_ to be displayed to see the toggle switch's behavior:
