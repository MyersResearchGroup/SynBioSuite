### Repressilator

The repressilator consists of three promoters each with a repressor gene. It is a cyclic negative-feedback loop, periodically inducing the synthesis of green fluorescent proteins [1].

When opening [SynBioSuite](https://synbiosuite.org/) in Google Chrome click the blue __Open Folder__ button located in the top left corner. Select this folder, _Example 1_, and allow the site to edit its files. You will then see the Repressilator under the SBOL Component menu and the Analysis under the Analysis menu. After double-clicking on the SBOL file, SBOLCanvas will open and the following will be displayed:

When opening the Analysis with a double click you can click the __Run Analysis__ button to start the simulation. After the simulation is finished you will see a blue 1 next to the _RESULTS_ tab in the top left corner. After selecting the _RESULTS_ tab, select _LacI_, _TetR_, and _GFP_ to be displayed to see the oscillating behavior:

You can also run your own analysis by clicking the __+ New Analysis__ button and following the steps shown. The given example does not have associated sequences. However, they are not needed to use SynBioSuite's simulation and analysis capabilities
